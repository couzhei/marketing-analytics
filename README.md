# Marketing Analytics

These are the datasets, notebooks, and papers I have been working on at a short notice, when I was at [Basalam](https://basalam.com/). It clearly indicates the challenges I faced during that time for the task given, which at the time was completely unknown to me, but now I think it was what can be called _Marketing Analytics_, hence the name of this repo.

There are many people, articles and books that I'm grateful and want to thank them personally, some of which you can find in the papers folder, and some less obvious ones would be [Peter Fader](https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/faderp/), my supervisor [Mr. Bashari](https://github.com/mhbashari), and [Barış Karaman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karamanbaris/?originalSubdomain=ae).

I might be planning on to update these, make a clear intro and navigation through notebooks. But let them rest for now :P

### Want to play with these notebooks online without having to install anything?
Use any of the following services (I recommended Colab or Kaggle, since they offer free GPUs and TPUs).

**WARNING**: _Please be aware that these services provide temporary environments: anything you do will be deleted after a while, so make sure you download any data you care about._
